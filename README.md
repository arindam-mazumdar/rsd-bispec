## RSD-Bispec

This package computes the multipoles of redshift space bispectrum.
There are four files 

 - "multipoles.py" 
 - "terms.py"
 - "bispec_functions.py"
 - "kernels.py"
 - Additional "pk.dat" provides matter power spectrum calculated using CLASSS code.

1.) "multipoles.py" is the master file. To compute any multipole user need to
    >> import "multipoles.py" as ml .
Then, any multipole can be computed using the following form
 ml.multipole(l,m,k_1, mu,t,beta_1,b_1,gamma_2)
The details of each argument can be found in ref[1]. 

"multipoles.py" imports the other mentioned files.

2.) "terms.py" computes the R,S,T terms as described in ref[1].

3.) "bispec_functions.py" sets the cosmological parameters. It 
interpolates the externally provided matter power spectrum, P(k), [pk.dat] 
and it can extrapolate the value of P(k) at any redshift z assuming 
an LCDM cosmology.

4.) "kernels.py" provides the expression of second-order standard 
perturbation theory (SPT) kernels as F and G in terms of 
mu and t. The difference between F and G is also computed as dG

5.) "pk.dat" is a data file generated by Boltzmann code CLASS which 
provides the matter power spectrum. The cosmological parameters used 
to generate "pk.dat" were set as per Planck's 2015 results[2].
