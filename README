This package computes the multipoles of redshift space bispectrum.
There are four files 
1. "multipoles.py" :
2. "terms.py":
3. "bispec_functions.py"
4. "kernels.py"
5. "pk.dat"

1.) "multipoles.py" is the master file. To compute any multipole user need to
    >> import "multipoles.py" as ml .
Then, any multpiole can be computed using following form
 ml.multipole(l,m,k_1,mu,t,beta_1,b_1,gamma_2)
where, the details of each argument can be found in ref[]. 

"multipoles.py" imports the other mentioned files.

2.) "terms.py" computes the R,S,T terms as described in ref[].

3.) "bispec_functions.py" sets the cosmological parameters. It 
interpolates the externally provided matter power spectrum, P(k), [pk.dat] 
and it can extrapolate the value of P(k) at any redshift z assuming 
a LCDM cosmology.

4.) "kernels.py" provides the expression of second order standard 
perurturbation theory (SPT) kernels as F and G in terms of 
mu and t. The difference between F and G is also computed as dG

5.) "pk.dat" is a data file generated by Blotzmann code CLASS which 
provides the matter power spectrum. The cosmological parametrs used 
for generation of "pk.dat" were set as per Planck 2015 cosmogical results[2].
